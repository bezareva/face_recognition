Face recognition and occlusion identification.
<hr>

Goal of this project was to observe how occlusions
impact face recognition process using Python language. 

Source of face photos was Yale Faces database: http://cvc.cs.yale.edu/cvc/projects/yalefaces/yalefaces.html

Firstly, faces without occlusion were introduced:

Then, faces with different occlusions (glasses, lightning, face expression etc.). 

![subject01.leftlight.jpeg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bezareva/static/master/face_recognition/subject01.leftlight.jpeg)

![subject01.cover5.jpeg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bezareva/static/master/face_recognition/subject01.cover5.jpeg)

![subject01.glasses.gif.jpeg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bezareva/static/master/face_recognition/subject01.glasses.gif.jpeg)

Success rate was above 90%.
